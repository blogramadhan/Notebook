Pictures were a little deceiving on size of room, and you can hear everything through the walls so little to no privacy. Other than that it was a great little place to stay with plenty of sights to see! Would stay again definitely.",4.0

4461613.0,1.14e+18,2024-04-27,4,2024,7933472,Seth,"While the location of the rental was great, as it was within walking distance of Boston Commons and so many places to eat and drink, I ultimately wish that I would have just booked a hotel room because the place was so small that I felt very cramped (I hit my head off the mounted TV in the room about 20 times). The room was not much larger than full size bed, and one side of the bed seemed nearly impossible to use because if one were to try to  sit up, the angled roof would be in the way. In fact, the only place that I have ever had such a small room, particularly for the price, was in Tokyo, and at least there, it makes sense because of the population density. If the price were lower or it had any amenities like an early check-in or free bike usage or  really anything, maybe it would be worth the money, but as it is, I would gladly shell out an extra $50 for a hotel room next time because. It's too bad because it kind of turned me off using Airbnb for awhile.",2.0

4461901.0,1.07e+18,2024-01-19,1,2024,20775004,Adam,"Pros: The space is super nice, decent sized studio, couch, decent bathroom, functional kitchen. Space was clean. The refrigerator is only a micro fridge which might be difficult for long term stays, which I booked. The location is excellent, very close to restaurants and the prime of Boston<br/>The big con: The walls are paper thin and you can literally here anything the neighbors are doing as if it were in your apartment. If the neighbor's sink is on, it sounds like a shower over your bed. If they use the microwave, it sounds like it's cooking right next to you. There are supposed to be quiet hours after 9 pm. but that is impossible to enforce remotely (no management on site). I appreciate the owner worked with me to refund the balance of my stay (nearly all of it).",3.0

Walking distance to everything I wanted to do downtown Boston. The place was on the smaller size but perfect for just me and my 2 night stay. It was quiet and in a nice location.

I wouldn't describe it as ""stylish"" per the listing. The room was kept very clean, but it had what seemed like a permanent smell of cleaning supply fumes that were unpleasant. It was a basic room at a good price that did the job for me during a business trip on a budget, and that seems like the best use case.

Communication with the Maverick staff via the Airbnb app was top-notch; they were incredibly responsive and helpful, providing great local tips.<br/>Unfortunately Boston chill did creep in, and it took a while to warm up the space with the electric heater provided. Also, be prepared for a bit of a sound-travel issue due to a gap under the door going into the hallway and thin walls - removing any real sense of privacy when wishing to take calls or listen to music. <br/>On the plus side, the studio is conveniently located a mere 5-minute walk from the train station and offers excellent WiFi. It's perfect for a solo traveler on a short stay in Boston. The area around is quiet, safe, and picturesque, ideal for evening strolls. The bed, while comfy, is quite noisy, and the space feels more suited for short stays due to its size and the mentioned issues.",4.0

Location was great and that was definitely what we paid for when reserving this AirBnB. Staff were responsive as well. However, some parts of the AirBnB made our stay less enjoyable and quite frustrating. The cleaning service never came to our room, the TV would not connect to their cable box no matter what we tried, and the apartment was freezing at times. For what we paid, we thought that having a working TV and access to heat on a very cold weekend would‚Äôve been standard. The space was significantly smaller than the pictures show - it was extremely tight. This place would benefit from maintenance and updates to make it feel more homey as it was advertised. Luckily, due to the location, we didn‚Äôt spend a super large amount of time in the room. However, we would have liked the basic amenities to be more accessible while we were there.

While I still enjoyed the location quite a lot, I had to end my stay 5 nights early because a mouse walked out of my dresser onto the carpet. Naturally this disgusted me‚Äîupon calling the management they said to wait 15 minutes. Then, after an hour of silence, I called back and was told they had no other rooms and could wait for someone to set rat traps the next day. Are you kidding me? It‚Äôs a small one bedroom apartment, the rat was 5 feet from my bed where I stored my clothes, that‚Äôs disgusting and unhygienic. This is beyond disappointing. I‚Äôm glad I got some money back, no thanks to the management. If you‚Äôre in it just for location and don‚Äôt care about hygiene, this apartment is great. Otherwise, go elsewhere.",2.0

There's a great little market right next door for snacks and needed items. Trader Joe's is about 1.5 blocks away if you want a bigger selection. I purposely picked a unit facing the back/alley to minimize street noise. However, be prepared for EARLY morning visits by the trash trucks. I wear ear plugs so it didn't bother me, but my husband was definitely woken up. It's an old building and  bathroom is extremely small. If you're over about 5'9"" be prepared for your knees touching the wall in front of you while sitting on the toilet! On a happy note, the water pressure is great and there is plenty of hot water.  It's a little worn and could definitely use a refresh, but everything was clean. For us, the bed wasn't particularly comfortable, but that's a very personal thing. Should you stay here?

We booked an airbnb so that we would have access to a kitchen but there wasn‚Äôt a pan to cook in (there are pots) and there are no basics (salt and pepper for example) so we had to buy all of it including hand soap for the bathroom. The coffee offered is decaf so you will have to buy your own coffee too. <br/>The other downside was that the closet door doesn‚Äôt open all the way so you can‚Äôt open the drawers that are in there.

The kitchen and bathroom are small and basic, but get the job done.  Wifi worked well once I figured out how to get on.  The TV has direct TV with many channels. The trick is figuring out how to make it work.  The rest of this is a pro tip for getting the TV going: You have to make sure the box is on in the closet to start.  Then turn on the on button on the silver direct tv remote, then click the center select button on the black sony remote to chose TV and then use the silver remote to get to the guide and change channels.  A bit tricky, but I made it work.  Never did figure out how to use it as a smart tv, but didn't really need all of that tv, as there was so much to do.",5.0

Would not have been a big deal if it weren't so late at night having to wait outside for the owner to update the code. Bed was very hard so if you prefer a softer bed, you may not get the best sleep.

The location was in an absolutely perfect area for what my friend and I had planned. Surrounded by brownstones, not even 5 minutes from the Back Bay Station, and within 15 minutes from all our points of interest for the weekend. The room itself was on the smaller side, so it's better suited for short-term stays as opposed to long ones. The building is a 4-floor walkup, so accessibility may be an issue, FYI. As for the price, the base price for the room per night was fair. However, the cleaning and service fees are what made the total cost of our stay a little pricey for the room we stayed in, I felt. I imagine it's because they use a cleaning service, which makes sense. Despite that, it was worth it solely because of the convenient location. Overall, I recommend staying here for a short trip to Boston! The Maverick team will make sure you are well taken care of :)",4.0

When I arrived, the instructions for the lock were inaccurate. This happened with a previous stay also, and I was locked out for 1/2 hour waiting for a response after the first response was to re-send the original instructions with the wrong door code. When I went in the room, the heat was off/not working. I raised the heat but it never came on (it was 45F in the room). I messaged the host, who said they could send someone in the morning, but temp dropping. Maverick offered another room next door, same safety and heat issues. After 3 hours with no heat, I went to a hotel. Host messaged to look for a space heater in the closet -- the room had neither a closet or a space heater. The neighborhood is nice, and feels safe to walk in alone at night, other rooms in the building are reasonable. Other guests are quiet and polite",2.0

Next thing is there was a vent by the door blowing cold air in the middle of the winter! They said they would fix the next day. Not fixed. I then texted again. Said they would fix next day. Not fixed so gave up. Also the place is located with windows in an alley and VERY noisy especially when the garbage truck shows up at 4 am. Nicely remodeled place for a night.,2.0

However the studio was very small with just enough room to get around the bed but no hanging space.<br/>The main problem though was that the studio was on the basement floor with the window overlooking a carpark. Every morning at 5.30am a large dustbin lorry reversed with it's warning sounds beeping to empty a very large container which made an enormous amount of noise. This went on for around 10 minutes each morning. Then, from around 8am, cars were reversed right up to our window.<br/>There were no net curtains so we had to close the curtains for the entire stay to get some privacy. <br/>We asked to change apartment but the owner said the rest were full.",2.0

Large, modern, marble tiled bathroom.<br/>The problem is with a few additions it could be so much better.  Want to work? There is no place to operate a computer.  A tiny (rotating!) high, narrow table with two pedestal chairs with no backs to sit on. Very uncomfortable. After ten minutes you give up.  The room is huge and could accommodate a table/desk easily with two to four high backed chairs.  IKEA has them cheap!<br/>Buy a bottle of wine to bring home?  Only two paper coffee cups are in the room, not even plastic cups are available.  No bath soap (!), none.  Two tiny bottles each of shampoo and conditioner.  I used the shampoo as ""body wash"" until the next day when I bought a bar of soap.<br/>I am 5'7"" and the adjustable shower head, at max, barely reached my head. Bad design/installation.",3.0

Safe and clean building. Many quick food options around the corner, and a coffee shop too. <br/>The bad: the AC/heating/humidity control/vent system appeared to not work. Right after check-in I got quick, but not reassuring responses. The day after the communication got more professional, I was promised a technician... and for the next two days nothing happened. Temperature in the room was 75-77 and it was stuffy. The window doesn't open. <br/>Would have been a great stay if not for what I hope was a rare screw-up.",3.0

The room was VERY small, which was ok as we did not spend much time there. However, for such a highly rated host and expensive stay, I expected to have shampoo and conditioner that actually worked. It seemed like they were diluted with water. If that is not the case, they definitely need a better product for their toiletries. Additionally, there was no body wash at all. This was odd considering the presence of the other toiletry products. While makeup wipes were provided, 2/3 of them must have been expired, as they were completely dried out and didn't work well when I added water. The place was nice overall but again, it appears that some corners are getting cut in terms of very basic amenities.",3.0

The host, with a very bad attitude, offered to clean the unit and in the meantime offered us to stay temporarily in another unit in the same building, which we did not accept.

So many bars, restaurants and shopping close by to walk to made it easy not having a car. A few downsides are if youre traveling for multiple days with more than yourseld, theres no where to store your clothes! We got to meet the architect of the building and he said they will work on that. (Fingers cross for next time) They also only give you one towel each for 4 days and if you want more its $25 or you can go wash it yourself in the basement coin laundry. We both were not a fan of that. Other than that, it was a perfect place to stay and ill definitely book this place again next time im in Boston. (I just gotta remember to bring my own towel)",4.0

We tried to open the window, but it was stuck closed.  It was very uncomforatble to sleep.  After 2 messages and 2 calls, we were sent instructions on how to use the thermostat, which did not work.  After more messages and calls we were sent a box fan, which only helped to move the hot air around.  The temperature got as high as 81 degrees in the room with the fan on!!!.  We were also told that the whole side of the building was experiencing the same thing.  Yet no maintenance was sent to check or try to correct the problem.<br/>We were there for the marathon and coming back to an 80-degree room was not very welcoming.  I had read a review about the same thing happening in the winter and the heater not working!  <br/>The location was GREAT, but because we were so uncomfortable, and nothing was really done to remedy the situation we will never stay with this owner again.<br/>FIX THE PROBLEM!",2.0

We learned the hard way when we found ourselves awake and sweating all night stranded in a humid sauna. Messages to the host were met with no action and we had to vacate the room for our own comfort just to wander the streets of Boston waiting for a response. 18 hours later, we returned to our room alarmed to find someone in it! It was a staff member sent by the host attempting to resolve the issue by propping open a window and bringing a box fan. Totally unacceptable! The host ultimately offered another room, but at that point we were checking out the next morning, so we reluctantly stayed. We wasted money for two nights stay on a room we could not stay in. It basically just served as storage for our luggage. I waited to see if the host would make it right before posting this and he didn‚Äôt‚Äîthe host chose not to compensate us for our losses and the experience completely ruined our trip.

The building itself was gorgeous and well-maintained, and I picked it mainly for location, not for size or amenities. It was *tiny*, but it was just my son and me in town, so that was OK, and I didn't feel like the size was oversold. <br/>Maverick was quickly responsive when I had a first-night question about the cooling system. All instructions, etc., were clear and concise. For my purposes--proximity to Boston U., Newbury Street and Fenway Park--it was perfect. I've always liked the area around the Fens. <br/>Overall, a very nice stay. The Airbnb hotel aspect meant my son and I didn't really get the ""actual person's Boston apartment"" experience very much, but that wasn't a big deal. I was perfectly happy with the place and with all my interactions. Would definitely deal with the Maverick team again. Thanks for a nice place to stay!",5.0

I accidentally dropped something off the corner of the bed and was amazed to find that even the carpet behind the bed in the corner was really clean :) speaking of which, the bed and linens were really nice and very comfortable. The building is a really cool restored brownstone with a beautiful circular staircase.  Instructions for getting into the building and unit were very clear and easy. One heads up - Waze kept sending us to the back of the building, which is an alleyway. It took us a few circles to figure out how to come around to the front. Would be helpful to add instructions on this. Also , good to know that you can park for two hours- ‚Äúvisitors  parking‚Äù in front of the building - so loading / unloading was easy. Location was great- especially convenient for attending anything at BoCo. We had one issue with shower water pressure, which the owner said would be taken care of.
